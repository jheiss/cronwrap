This cronwrap has some interesting features around warning or terminating jobs
that run longer than expected:  http://www.uow.edu.au/~sah/cronwrap.html

This one is much simpler, but also does the warning if job runs longer than
expected:  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/cronwrap

A variant of the overtime feature I'd like is an option to kill the older job
on the assumption that it is stuck. In this mode of operation cronwrap should
attempt to kill the old job, then check to see if it actually exited. If not
abort, if so proceed with starting a new instance of the job.
